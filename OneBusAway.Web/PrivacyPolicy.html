    <b>OneBusAway does not collect, store, or share any of your personal information.</b>
    <p />
    <b>We do not track your searches or record your actions.</b>

    If you authorize OneBusAway to use your location, we will use your latitude and longitude to find nearby bus stops. This information 
    is not stored, it is simply sent anonymously to onebusaway.org to find nearby locations.

    We're not interested in advertising to you. We didn't write this app to make money. We're just a group of volunteers who want to make public transportation 
    easy and accessible to all of Seattle.
